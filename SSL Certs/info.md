* SSL certificate makes the site HTTPS and establishes a secure connection betwen client and server. It avoids man in the middle attack.
* CA means certificate authority.
* Every domain should have it's own SSL certificate.
* You can have a wildcard domain certificate to apply it for all subdomains. Say if the cert subject is "*.example.com", is a wildcard SSL cert and will be accepted by the client.
