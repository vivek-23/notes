<label for="some_name">asjkdh</label>
<input type='checkbox' name='some_name' id='some_name' />

<!-- 

In the above code, when the user clicks on the label, the checkbox gets checked,
rather than making the user to click the checkbox manually.
Relation is established with a "for" attribute of label being the same as "id" value of the input element.
